# Nexus Radio: Development Strategy

## I. ARCHITECTURAL PHILOSOPHY
Nexus Radio follows the **Recursive Learning & Extraction** protocol. It is designed not as a static application, but as an evolving embedded environment that bridges web-based P2P protocols with native hardware capabilities.

## II. THE HIERARCHY OF EVOLUTION

### Level 0: Pattern Acquisition
- Continuous monitoring of low-latency WebRTC patterns.
- Extraction of high-performance audio tokens from the VDO.Ninja ecosystem.

### Level 1: Structural Integration
- Deep-linking the Chromium WebView with the Android Kernel via the **NexusBridge**.
- Bypassing standard mobile browser restrictions for "Always-On" radio functionality.

### Level 2: AI Autonomy
- Implementation of Edge-AI (Local VAD) to manage bandwidth.
- Self-optimizing thresholds based on environmental noise floor analysis.

### Level 3: Network Synthesis
- Scaling the individual radio node into a mesh-capable "Enterprise Dashboard" component.
- Bi-directional telemetry flows for remote fleet management of radio nodes.

## III. TECH STACK
- **Frontend**: Modified VDO.Ninja Core (Vanilla JS / Web Audio API).
- **Embedded**: Android Pie (API 28+) / Java Native Bridge.
- **Protocol**: WebRTC P2P / Bluetooth A2DP & HID.
- **AI**: Local threshold-based Voice Activity Detection.

## IV. ROADMAP
- [x] NexusBridge v2.0 Implementation.
- [x] AI Hysteresis and Transmit Feedback.
- [x] Home Launcher Primary System integration.
- [ ] Bluetooth LE Audio (LEA) Broadcast Multi-sync.
- [ ] On-device speech-to-text (STT) for remote transcript logs.
